# Finance_Calculator
a Simple Finance Calculator
a program that allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.
The first output that the user sees when the program runs is a menu where they can choose which calculator they want to use either  an investment calculator or a home loan repayment calculator.
They choose by typing in either "bond" or "investment".
If the user types "investment" the programme will ask the user to input: 
* The amount of money that they are depositing. 
* The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number of the interest rate should be entered   
* The number of years they plan on investing for.  
* Then ask the user to input whether they want “simple” or “compound” interest, and store this in a variable called ​interest​. Depending on whether they typed “simple” or “compound”.
And then it calculates what their investment will be according to all their inputs.
If the user types "bond" the programme will ask the user to input:
* The present value of the house. E.g. 100000  
* The interest rate. E.g. 7  
* The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond. E.g. 120
And calculate and print how much the user will pay each month
